# Picobot GenAlg

Creates genetic algorithms for HMC's [Picobot](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/).

Run the GA(population, generations) function to start messing around and create a program.There are two ways to test your programs:

1.    Copy & paste its ruleset directly into the Picobot [homepage](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/).

2.    Call the run(steps) method in your favorite Python shell.

The first option is probably more fun, the second being an ASCII Picobot simulator. Enjoy!
