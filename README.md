# Picobot GenAlg

Uses genetic algorithms to create rulesets for HMC's [Picobot](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/).

One-function goodness! Just call `GA(populationSize, generations)` to start messing around and create a program. Once created, there are two ways to test your program:

1.    Paste its ruleset directly into the Picobot [homepage](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/).

2.    Call the `run(steps)` method in your favorite Python shell.

The former is probably more fun, since the latter is just an ASCII Picobot simulator.
Have fun and don't forget to connect to Skynet!
